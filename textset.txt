how did you break your leg
i slipped on the stairs and fell down i broke my leg
your right hand is swollen does it hurt
it's bleeding you'd better go see a doctor about that cut
i hope you'll be well soon
i get out of bed about seven every morning
after getting up i go into the bathroom and take a shower
then i shave brush my teeth and comb my hair
after brushing my teeth i put on my clothes
after that i go downstairs to the kitchen to have breakfast
after eating breakfast i go back upstairs again
then it's usually time to wake up my little brother
he can't dress himself yet because he's too young
i wash his face and hands and then i dress him
he tries to button his own shirt but he can't do it
my little brother takes a bath before he goes to bed at night
he always forgets to wash behind his ears
i'm always tired when i come home from work
at bedtime i take off my clothes and put on my pajamas
i get into bed at about night and go right off to sleep
what do you think is that right
certainly you're mistaken about that
i think you're mistaken about that
i like hot weather best
personally i prefer winter weather
do you think it's going to rain tomorrow
i don't know whether it will rain or not
in my opinion that's an excellent idea

i think you have very attractive children
please give me your frank opinion

what do you plan to do tomorrow
i doubt that i'll do anything tomorrow
please excuse me for a little while i want to do something
i imagine i'll do some work instead of going to the movies
will it be convenient for you to explain your plans to him
there's nothing to do because tomorrow is a holiday
what's your brother planning to do tomorrow
he can't decide what to do
it's difficult to make a decision without knowing all the facts
we're trying to plan our future
that's a good idea
i'm hoping to spend a few days in the mountains
would you consider going north this summer
if there's a chance you'll go i'd like to go with you
after you think it over please let me know what you decide
i'm anxious to know what your decision is
i'm confident you've made the right choice
i want to persuade you to change your mind
will you accept my advice
what have you decided
i've definitely decided to go to california
he didn't want to say anything to influence my decision
she refuses to make up her mind
i assume you've decided against buying a new car
it took him a long time to make up his mind
you can go whenever you wish
we're willing to accept your plan
he knows it's inconvenient but he wants to go anyway
according to mr green this is a complicated problem
she insists that it doesn't make any difference to her
are you going to go anyplace this year
if i have enough money i'm going to take a trip abroad
how are you going are you going by boat
it's faster to go by plane than by boat

by the time we got there the play had already begun
the usher showed us to our seats
the cast of the play included a famous actor
after the play was over we all wanted to get something to eat
there was a big crowd and we had difficulty getting a taxi
the restaurant was filled so we decided to go elsewhere
